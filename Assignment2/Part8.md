## Advantages and Disadvantages of Adding the MongoDB Pipeline to Data Architecture

### Advantages

1. **Improved Analysis Query Performance**  
   MongoDB’s pipeline allows you to perform complex data transformations and analytics directly within the database.  
   This reduces the need to pull large datasets into external applications for processing, improving performance and reducing network overhead.

2. **Scalability for Parallel Processing**  
   MongoDB’s sharding and distributed setup let you scale out easily as your data grows. Therefore it can spread the work across multiple servers, so even with large datasets, your queries stay fast and handle heavy read loads without slowing down.

### Disadvantages

1. **Data Redundancy and Integrity Risks**  
   When pipelines are used to denormalize data into new collections for faster reads, redundancy can occur.  
   This can cause issues if updates don’t make it to every related collection, leading to mismatched or out-of-date information.

2. **Increased Development and Maintenance Effort**  
   Designing and maintaining MongoDB pipelines can be complex, especially as queries grow more complicated.  
   Developers must handle schema changes, nested documents, and performance tuning manually, which increases overall development time and risk of errors.

3. **Higher Data Latency for Real-Time Use Cases**  
   MongoDB pipelines often introduce additional processing steps that can delay real-time data availability.  
   This makes them less suitable for use cases requiring instant updates, since computed results may lag behind live transactional data.
